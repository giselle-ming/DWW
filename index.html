        <h3>Dragonets</h3>
        <p>Dragonets are beginner swimmers who are just starting to learn the fundamentals of swimming. They focus on basic
          water
          safety, floating, and learning the elementary strokes like freestyle and backstroke. Dragonets are building
          confidence
          in the water and developing their basic swimming abilities.</p>

        <h3>Pendragons</h3>
        <p>Pendragons are intermediate-level swimmers who have a good grasp of basic swimming strokes and techniques. They are
          comfortable swimming longer distances and can perform more advanced drills. Pendragons are still developing their
          endurance and speed but have a solid foundation in swimming skills.</p>

        breaststroke, and butterfly) and demonstrate strong endurance, speed, and technique in the water. They can perform
        complex swimming drills and have a deep understanding of swim strategies and competition rules.</p>
